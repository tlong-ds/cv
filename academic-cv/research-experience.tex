    \textbf{Research Assistant}, Predictive Models and Machine Learning Research Applications, NEU.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed validation frameworks for predictive economic models, conducting \textbf{ablation studies} to isolate feature importance and ensure statistical robustness.
        \item Fine-tuned transformer-based architectures (BERT/RoBERTa) for domain-specific NLP tasks, monitoring \textbf{loss convergence} and optimizing inference latency for real-time deployment.
        \item \textbf{Key Contribution:} Engineered a robust data preprocessing pipeline that reduced text noise by 20\%, significantly strictly alignment with downstream model requirements.
    \end{itemize}
